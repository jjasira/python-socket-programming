Setup and Configuration:

Create a Python project directory.
Create a config.ini file for configuration settings like linuxpath, REREAD_ON_QUERY, and SSL_ENABLED.
Use Python's configparser module to parse the configuration file.
SSL Configuration:

Implement SSL/TLS using Python's ssl module.
Generate a self-signed certificate or use pre-shared keys (PSK) based on the configuration.
Handle SSL configuration in the server script.
Server Script:

Create a Python script for the server (server.py).
Use multithreading for handling concurrent connections.
Implement a TCP server using Python's socket module.
Accept connections and receive data from clients.
File Search Algorithm:

Implement file search logic based on the String received from clients.
Depending on REREAD_ON_QUERY, either read the file on every query or load it once.
Response Handling:

Send appropriate responses (STRING EXISTS or STRING NOT FOUND) back to clients.
Include debug logs with search query, IP address, execution time, timestamps, etc.
Security Measures:

Implement buffer overflow protection.
Handle other potential security issues.
Ensure robust exception handling with clear error messages.
Unit Tests:

Write unit tests using pytest to cover different execution scenarios:
Varying file sizes (from 10,000 to 1,000,000 rows).
Varying numbers of queries per second.
Edge cases and exceptions.
Client Script:

Create a Python client script (client.py) for testing purposes.
Use Python's socket module to connect to the server.
Send test queries and receive responses.
Speed Testing and Report:

Benchmark different file search algorithms and options:
Linear search
Binary search (if applicable)
Hash-based search (e.g., using dictionaries)
Regular expression search
Custom optimized search (bonus point)
Measure performance based on file sizes and number of queries per second.
Generate a speed testing report with a table and chart comparing the algorithms' performances.
Documentation and Packaging:

Ensure PEP8 and PEP20 compliance.
Add type hints and docstrings for clarity.
Document the code professionally.
Package the code neatly with a requirements.txt file.
Create a README.md explaining how to install and run the server as a Linux daemon or service.
Submission:

Organize the project structure.
Include all necessary files in a zip file for submission:
Code files (server.py, client.py, etc.)
Configuration file (config.ini)
Test data (if applicable)
Speed testing report (PDF format)
README.md with installation instructions
requirements.txt
This outline should give you a comprehensive guide to developing the server script and meeting all the specified requirements. Be sure to thoroughly test the code and handle all edge cases and exceptions.
